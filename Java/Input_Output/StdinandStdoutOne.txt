HACKERRANK Problem - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-stdin-and-stdout-1/problem

Brief description of the problem:
Read in 3 consecutive integers and print them out using the Java's Console.

Answer in Java 8:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();     //Written Code
        int c = scan.nextInt();     //Written Code
    
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);      //Written Code
        System.out.println(c);      //Written Code
    }

How does it work?
    The two lines that say "scan.nextInt()" take in the next user input that is an integer and assigns them 
    to variables b and c. The "System.out.println(_)" then prints the variable to the console.
