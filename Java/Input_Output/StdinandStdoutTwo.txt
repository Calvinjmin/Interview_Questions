HACKERRANK Problem - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-stdin-stdout/problem

Brief description of the problem:
Using Java's Console, take in a integer, a double, and a string using stdin, then print the values
in the order defined in the instructions. 

Answer in Java 8:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();             //Written Code
        double d = scan.nextDouble();       //Written Code
        scan.nextLine();                    //Written Code
        String s = scan.nextLine();         //Wrtiten Code
        scan.close();                       //Written Code

        System.out.println("String: " + s);
        System.out.println("Double: " + d);
        System.out.println("Int: " + i);
    }

How does it work?
    One part of the code that seems different from most is the first "scan.nextLine()" after the initalization of 
    the double variable. This is due to the cursor being at the end of the line with the double, so that 
    line must be used to move the cursor to the next line. Everything else is very similar to StdinandStdoutOne!
